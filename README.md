## Project Title:  
Building a serverless applicaation with AWS Lambda.

---

## Project Description
Serverless computing is transforming application development, offering scalability, cost-efficiency, and simplicity. As part of my journey into modern cloud technologies, I had the opportunity to build a serverless application using AWS Lambda. This hands-on experience provided a deep dive into serverless architecture, API management, and cloud-native practices.

---

## Hereâ€™s what I accomplished:
- Designed and Implemented Lambda Functions: Developed lightweight, event-driven functions to handle specific application logic.
- Integrated API Gateway: Created RESTful APIs to securely interact with the Lambda functions, enabling seamless communication between the client and server.
- Explored AWS Services: Leveraged the power of serverless architecture to build a scalable and efficient application without the need to manage infrastructure.

---

## Key learning
- Mastered building serverless workflows with AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
- Enhanced skills in designing cloud-native applications with a focus on agility and performance.

---

## Technology Used
- AWS Lambda(Lambda Funtions)
- API Gateway

---

## Coclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with serverless architecture, showcasing the scalability and efficiency of AWS Lambda. It strengthened my understanding of API integration and event-driven workflows in cloud-native applications.

---

## Future Scope
- Integrate advanced AWS services like DynamoDB for data persistence.
- Implement monitoring tools such as AWS CloudWatch for enhanced performance tracking.
- Expand serverless workflows with AWS Step Functions for complex application orchestration.
